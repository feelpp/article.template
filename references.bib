	title = {Optimisation topologique de systèmes multiphysiques},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-02441844},
	abstract = {This work is devoted to shape and topology optimization of multiphysics systemsmotivated by aeronautic industrial applications. Shape derivatives of arbitraryobjective functionals are computed for a weakly coupled thermal fluid-structuremodel. A novel gradient flow type algorithm is then developed for solving genericconstrained shape optimization problems without the need for tuning non-physicalmetaparameters. Motivated by the need for enforcing non-mixing constraints in thedesign of liquid-liquid heat exchangers, a variational method is developed in orderto simplify the numerical evaluation of geometric constraints: it allows to computeline integrals on a mesh by solving a variational problem without requiring theexplicit knowledge of these lines on the spatial discretization. All theseingredients allowed us to implement a variety of 2-d and 3-d multiphysics shapeoptimization test cases: from single, double or three physics problems in 2-d, tomoderately large-scale 3-d test cases for structural design, thermal conduction,aerodynamic design and a fluid-structure interacting system. A final opening chapterderives high order homogenized equations for perforated elliptic systems. These highorder equations encompass the three classical regimes of homogenized modelsassociated with different obstacle's size scalings. They could allow, in futureworks, to develop new topology optimization methods for fluid systems characterizedby multi-scale patterns as commonly encountered in industrial heat exchanger designs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we obtain the first-order necessary optimality conditions of an optimal control problem for a distributed parameter system with geometric control, namely, the minimum-drag problem in Stokes flow (flow at a very low Reynolds number). We find that the unit-volume body with smallest drag must be such that the magnitude of the normal derivative of the velocity of the fluid is constant on the boundary of the body. In a three-dimensional uniform flow, this condition implies that the body with minimum drag has the shape of a pointed body similar in general shape to a prolate spheroid but with some differences including conical front and rear ends of angle 120°.},
